<p>HTML 2.0 was the original standard for HTML and the set of tags that all browsers should support. You can create perfectly good web pages using only tags that were included in HTML 2.0

    The HTML 3.2 specification was developed in early 1996. Several software vendors; joined with the W3C to develop this specification. Some of the primary additions to HTML 3.2 included features such as tables, applets, and text flow around images.
    
    HTML 4.0, first introduced in 1997, incorporated many new features that gave designers greater control over page layout than HTML 2.0 and 3.2. Like HTML 2.0 and 3.2, the W3C created the HTML 4.0 standard.
    
    HTML 5 can be said for an extended version of HTML 4.01, which was published in the year 2012.
